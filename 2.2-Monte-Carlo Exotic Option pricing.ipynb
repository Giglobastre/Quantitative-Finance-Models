    "# Pricing Exotic Options Using Monte Carlo Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Monte Carlo (MC) simulation is an essential method for pricing exotic options, particularly when analytical solutions are unavailable. In this markdown, we explain the mathematical principles behind pricing three exotic option types: **Asian**, **Barrier**, and **American** options, using Monte Carlo simulation. Here's how the method is implemented for each type.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)\n",
    "We start by simulating the underlying asset's price using **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)**. The GBM model incorporates both drift (growth at the risk-free rate) and volatility (random fluctuations) to model the future evolution of the asset price. The discrete GBM formula is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "S_{t+1} = S_t \\cdot \\exp \\left( (r - \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2) \\Delta t + \\sigma \\sqrt{\\Delta t} Z_t \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $S_t$ is the asset price at time $t$,\n",
    "- $r$ is the risk-free interest rate,\n",
    "- $\\sigma$ is the volatility,\n",
    "- $\\Delta t$ is the time step,\n",
    "- $Z_t$ is a random variable drawn from a standard normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why $( S_{t+1} $) instead of $( S_t $) for Exotic Options?\n",
    "\n",
    "For European options, the payoff depends solely on the asset's price at maturity $( S_T $). In these cases, we're primarily concerned with the final price and not the intermediate prices during the option's life.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, exotic options such as **Asian options** or **Barrier options** require knowledge of the entire price path of the asset. For example:\n",
    "- **Asian Options**: The payoff depends on the average price of the asset over its lifetime, requiring the values of all $( S_t $) during the option's life.\n",
    "- **Barrier Options**: The payoff is influenced by whether the asset price crosses a specific barrier during the option's life, meaning we need to track each price $( S_{t+1} $).\n",
    "\n",
    "In these cases, itâ€™s essential to compute the price path step-by-step, building on the prior value $( S_t $) to capture the full evolution of the asset price over time.\n"

    "Monte Carlo methods provide a flexible and powerful approach to pricing exotic options. They simulate many possible future paths of the underlying asset using GBM and compute the average payoff, which is then discounted to the present to estimate the option price. For path-dependent options like Asian and Barrier options, and options with early exercise features like American options, Monte Carlo simulation is often one of the best methods available for accurate pricing."
