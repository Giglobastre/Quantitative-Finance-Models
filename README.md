## Project Overview

This repository aims to:

- Implement and test key models used in quantitative finance for **pricing derivatives**, **risk management**, and **volatility forecasting**.
- Compare different numerical methods for accuracy, efficiency, and practicality.
- Provide **visualizations**, **code explanations**, and **mathematical insights** to help understand the models and methods.
- Offer an accessible and educational platform for anyone interested in **quantitative finance**, whether they are beginners or advanced quants.

## Models Covered

Here are some of the key models we explore and implement in this repository:

- **Black-Scholes Model**: Analytical pricing for European options.
- **Monte Carlo Simulations**: Numerical methods for simulating paths of the underlying asset and estimating option prices.
- **Binomial Trees**: Step-by-step discrete-time model to compute option prices.
- **Finite Difference Methods**: For solving partial differential equations (PDEs) related to pricing derivatives.
- **Heston Model**: Stochastic volatility model for capturing dynamics of volatility.
- **Local Volatility Models**: Methods for pricing derivatives with volatility surfaces.

Each model is implemented with a focus on accuracy, computational performance, and ease of understanding.

## Numerical Methods

For each model, we employ various numerical techniques such as:

- **Monte Carlo Simulation** for estimating option prices through random sampling.
- **Finite Difference Methods** for solving differential equations associated with derivative pricing.
- **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)** for option pricing in the frequency domain.
- **Numerical Integration** methods for options and volatility modeling.

## Visualization

A key component of this repository is the **visualization of results**. By plotting option price surfaces, volatility smiles, and risk sensitivities, we provide a clear and intuitive understanding of how different parameters impact option pricing. Visuals include:

- 3D plots of **volatility surfaces**.
- Comparisons of **price sensitivities** for different strike prices and volatilities.
- **Monte Carlo** convergence and accuracy plots.
  
These help in better understanding the numerical methods' performance and behavior.
